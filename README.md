# TheTime-Unity
REST-API Project

In this project the user enters the name of a city and the country (ES Barcelona) and the application tells you what 
time it takes in that place.

First, a JSon file is consulted to obtain the identifier of the city.
With the identifier, we send a query to an API that returns a JSon with the necessary information to know the time.

Only works in a Android platform.
